Hello Everyone,

I am excited to share some of the Power BI reports I have created using datasets from Kaggle. These reports are part of my ongoing effort to enhance my data visualization skills and deepen my understanding of various datasets. My goal is to find the best and most optimal solutions for business needs by transforming raw data into actionable insights.

Feel free to explore the reports and see how I have optimized them to address different business scenarios. Your feedback is welcome as I continue to improve and refine my skills.
